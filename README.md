# **Hypothesizer CLI**

_Command Line Interface for interacting with OpenAI's API, parsing our database of hypotheses, and formatting Semgrep rules._

_These tools support [Hypothesizer](https://github.com/Alaboudi1/Hypothesizer-Debugger)._


## **_File Structure:_**

‚îÇ       Output.txt - _Outputs and logs can be found here after a run._

‚îÇ       Prompt.txt - _This is where prompts will go._

‚îÇ       System.txt - _This is where system instructions go._

‚îÇ       UseAPI.py - _The main function for the ChatBot, using OpenAPI._

‚îÇ

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄüìÅ**Parsers**

‚îÇ   hypotheses.json -  _This is a clone of the database, will be modified by some functions._

‚îÇ   input.txt -  _Necessary inputs such as Semgrep rules or Hypotheses will go here._

‚îÇ   output.txt - _Outputs and logs can be found here after a run._

‚îÇ   ParseDatabase.py - _Contains various functions that help manage the database._

‚îÇ   SemgrepConversion.py - _Converts a Semgrep rule in yaml into an Evidence in json._

‚îÇ

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄüìÅ**Recordings _(deprecated)_**

‚îÇ   ParseRecordings.py - _For analyzing Hypothesizer recordings, not used anymore._

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ recordings - _Some example recordings can be found here. (Buggy and Fixed bug recordings)_

## **_Using The Parsers:_**



1. **ParseDatabase.py: _Contains various functions that help manage the database._**

   **Example Usage:** ```python ParseDatabse.py functionName```


   **List of functions:**

    1. insertHypothesis - _Inserts the Hypothesis in input.txt into hypotheses.json._
    2. exampleHypothesis - _Prints the first Hypothesis in the DB._
    3. allHypotheses - _Prints all Hypotheses in the DB._
    4. getHypothesisById id - _Prints the Hypothesis in the DB with supplied id._
    
    <br>

    5. insertEvidence - _Inserts the Evidence object in input.txt into hypotheses.json._
    6. allEvidence - _Prints all Evidence in the DB._
    7. apiCalls - _Prints all API Evidence in the DB._
    8. domEvents - _Prints all DOM Evidence in the DB._
    9. networkEvents - _Prints all NetworkEvent Evidence in the DB._
    10. rawAPIEvidence - _Prints all API Evidence in the DB in raw json._
    11. rawDOMEvidence - _Prints all DOM Evidence in the DB in raw json._
    12. rawNetworkEvidence - _Prints all NetworkEvent Evidence in raw json._
    
2. **SemgrepConversion.py: _Converts Semgrep rule to Evidence object for DB_**

    **Example Usage:** ```python SemgrepConversion.py```

3. **ParseRecordings.py: _Parses recordings. Not used anymore but can be explored._**

   **Example Usage:**


   ```python3 ParseRecordings.py functionName fileName.json```

   ```python3 ParseRecordings.py exampleEntry example_recording.json```


    **Functions:**

    1. exampleEntry - _Prints the first object in the recording._
    2. entireDataset - _Prints all objects in the recording._
    3. getTypeValues - _Prints the type values in the recording._
    4. countOccurrences - _Prints the type values in the recording, with a count._
    5. withoutCodeCoverage - _Prints all objects in the recording, minus these._
    6. firstCodeCoverage - _Prints the first codeCoverage in the recording._


## **_Using The ChatBot (Chat-GPT API):_**

1. **Clone the repo** and create a .env file then add your OpenAI API Key.

    .env should only contain:

    ```OPENAI_KEY = sk-youropenaikey```

    Make sure this key is not shared.

2. **cd Hypothesizer-ChatBot**
3. Add your initial prompt into Prompt.txt, and your dedicated system instruction into System.txt
4. Run the python script:

    ```UseAPI.py  python UseAPI.py```

5. Follow the initial instructions given by the script and follow the prompts for a successful chat! 

_Please explore the code in UseAPI.py to check out just how easy it is to set up a simple ChatBot with OpenAI and some Python. This is just a simple chatbot, we found ourselves keeping with Phind and ChatGPT‚ÄôS UI most of the time, but this chatbot can be improved upon in the future._


# **JSON Database**

_The Hypothesizer database exists in the form of a json file called hypotheses.json. It is a large json object separated into 2 lists: evidence and hypotheses. The structure of each is explained below._


## **_Database Structure: Take a look at hypotheses.json in the repo for examples._**
